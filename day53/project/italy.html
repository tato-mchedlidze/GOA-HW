            <p>Walk in, and let your eye be inevitably drawn to the French doors that lead onto your balcony, where there's a view stretching from Bellagio to Balbianello. <br> It might be hard to ever come back inside; but when you do, the soaring ceilings, delicate palette, and beautifully-framed period prints
            and paintings will provoke their own delight.</p>
